# Nephalem guid through Functional Program in Scala

Over the years working with Scala, building large-scale projects, mentoring people and going to various Scala meetups I come with terms that probably most influential book in Scala ecosystem is: [Functional Programming in Scala by Paul Chiusano and Runar Bjarnason](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)

Usually referenced just as Red Book, it is a great read for getting up the speeds with, among others things, concepts like pure functions, functional data structures, property-based testing, and infamous monads. Probably because of its density, some parts of the book are a hurdle for some Scala [nephalems](http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Nephalem). 

I decided to go through book one more time and document my experience through a series of Twitch videos. As I'm a fan of Diablo series and Twitch is mostly used as a streaming service for gamers, I decided to map the Red Book book to [Diablo I](https://diablo.gamepedia.com/Diablo_Wiki). Videos will be focusing on exercises from the book and I will try to give my explanations why these exercises are useful and what should we take from them.

We will together explore:

- Cathedral - Introduction to Functional Programming
- Catacombs - Functional Design and Combinator Libraries
- Cave - Common Structures in Functional Design
- Hell - Effects and I/O
